        I'm currently on a Stutern scholarship partenering with I4G which is directed at Software development.

        I believe having experience in the health sector and technology can promote wellness of health
        in a quick and efficient manner and the access to health commodities and counselling are easier to obtain 
        at the comfort of your home.
